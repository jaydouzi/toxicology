# toxicology - decentralized, encrypted chat built on Tox

# Basics
Toxicology will bring together the privacy and security benefits of decentralized chat using toxcore with an intuitive, modern design built on Electron.

# Development Environment
##Requirements
- nodejs
- npm

After cloning the repo, install electron locally:

```
npm install --save-dev electron
```

You can then start the application for dev/testing using:

```
node\_modules/electron/dist/electron toxicology/
```

This method is likely to change as development progresses.
